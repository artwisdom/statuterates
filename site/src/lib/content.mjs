  'irs-underpayment': {
    tagline: 'What the IRS charges on unpaid federal tax.',
    q: 'What is the current IRS underpayment interest rate?',
    body: `The IRS underpayment rate is the interest the IRS charges individuals and businesses on tax they
paid late or underpaid. Under Internal Revenue Code §6621 it equals the federal short-term rate plus 3
percentage points, and it is reset every calendar quarter — so a figure that was right last quarter is
often wrong today. This page tracks the published value each quarter with its effective date.`,
  },
  'irs-overpayment-noncorporate': {
    tagline: 'What the IRS pays individuals on refunds/overpayments.',
    q: 'What is the current IRS overpayment interest rate for individuals?',
    body: `The non-corporate overpayment rate is the interest the IRS pays individual taxpayers when it holds
an overpayment (for example, a delayed refund). It is set quarterly under §6621 and, for non-corporate
taxpayers, equals the federal short-term rate plus 3 percentage points.`,
  },
  'irs-overpayment-corporate': {
    tagline: 'What the IRS pays corporations on overpayments.',
    q: 'What is the current IRS corporate overpayment interest rate?',
    body: `The corporate overpayment rate is the interest the IRS pays corporations on overpaid federal tax.
It is set quarterly under §6621 and is generally one percentage point below the equivalent non-corporate
rate (federal short-term rate plus 2 percentage points).`,
  },
  'irs-large-corporate-underpayment': {
    tagline: 'The higher rate on large corporate tax underpayments.',
    q: 'What is the current IRS large corporate underpayment (LCU) rate?',
    body: `The large corporate underpayment rate ("LCU") is an elevated rate that applies to sizable corporate
underpayments. Under §6621(c) it equals the federal short-term rate plus 5 percentage points and is reset
each quarter — two points above the ordinary underpayment rate.`,
  },
  'irs-gatt': {
    tagline: 'The reduced rate on large corporate overpayments above $10,000.',
    q: 'What is the current IRS GATT rate?',
    body: `The "GATT" rate applies to the portion of a corporate overpayment that exceeds $10,000. It equals
the federal short-term rate plus 0.5 percentage points — materially lower than the ordinary corporate
overpayment rate — and is reset quarterly under §6621.`,
  },
  'irs-6603-federal-short-term': {
    tagline: 'The federal short-term rate underlying every §6621 rate.',
    q: 'What is the current federal short-term rate used for IRS interest?',
    body: `The federal short-term rate is the base from which every IRS §6621 interest rate is built (each
category adds a fixed spread). The IRS publishes it quarterly; it is also the rate used for IRC §6603
cash deposits. Tracking it explains why all the other IRS rates move together each quarter.`,
  },
  'treasury-1-year-cmt': {
    tagline: 'The 1-year Treasury yield that sets the federal post-judgment rate.',
    q: 'What is the current 1-year Treasury constant maturity yield?',
    body: `The 1-year Treasury constant maturity (CMT) yield is published every business day by the Federal
Reserve (H.15). Its weekly average is the legal basis for the U.S. federal post-judgment interest rate
under 28 U.S.C. §1961, which is why it is tracked here as a weekly series alongside that rate.`,
  },
  'us-federal-post-judgment': {
    tagline: 'The interest that accrues on federal court money judgments.',
    q: 'What is the current U.S. federal post-judgment interest rate?',
    body: `The federal post-judgment interest rate is the interest that accrues on money judgments entered in
U.S. federal courts. By statute (28 U.S.C. §1961) it equals the weekly-average 1-year Treasury constant
maturity yield for the calendar week preceding the judgment — a value the U.S. Courts publish only as a
formula, not a number, and that changes every week. This page computes it from the official Federal
Reserve H.15 series and shows the weekly history.`,
